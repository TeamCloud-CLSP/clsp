# CLSP Rewrite

The Georgia Tech Critical Language Song Project (CLSP) is a web based learning managment system designed to immerse students in a language and enrich their learning experiences with music, videos, and other forms of media.

CLSP Rewrite is a rewrite of an older project with the same name, using modern web technologies like Symfony 3.2 and PHP 7.1.

## Disclaimer

The software is delivered as-is at the end of the semester, and there is no maintenance or service provided after software delivery.

This project was delivered, and the hand off was performed on (April 25th, 2017). After this point, we will not support or make any further changes.

If you would like to make changes, please fork this repository on Github.

In the [INSTALLATION.md](https://github.com/TeamCloud-CLSP/clsp/blob/master/INSTALLATION.md), we've done our best to explain how to run the CLSP rewrite project on a production server. However, we cannot account for every possible server configuration. 

We cannot guarantee that this application will run on your server out of the box. Some configuration work may be required.

The project was demoed and tested using the dev configuration. For more information on how to run and test the dev configuration, read [DEV.md](https://github.com/TeamCloud-CLSP/clsp/blob/master/DEV.md) for the backend, and [README.md](https://github.com/TeamCloud-CLSP/clsp-frontend/blob/master/README.md) for the frontend.
